'''There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform two operations on this notepad for each step:
Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.'''

'''Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.'''

n= int(input("Number of times- "))

j=0

for i in range(2,n+1):
    if(n%i==0):
        j= j+i
        n/=i
print("Minimum number of operations-",j)

Output-

Number of times- 200
Minimum number of operations- 11
